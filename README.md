# Rejoice
An interpretor for a language inspired by Joy.

The purpose of this language is to stick to the Joy philosophy, but not necessarily to be completely backwards compatible. This is a toy research project after all!

For more about Joy, check out the [Joy archive](http://joy-lang.org) for papers, tutorials, and code from Dr Manfred von Thun, the creator of Joy.
